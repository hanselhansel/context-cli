# Scoring Rules

## Pillar Weights (NEVER change without explicit user request)
| Pillar | Max Points |
|--------|-----------|
| Content density | 40 |
| Robots.txt AI bot access | 25 |
| Schema.org JSON-LD | 25 |
| llms.txt presence | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

## Bot Checklist
GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, Google-Extended, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Amazonbot, OAI-SearchBot

## Rules
- Total score is always 0-100
- Each pillar score is 0 to its max points
- Site score = weighted average of page scores
- Never add/remove/reweight pillars without explicit user request
- New bots CAN be added to the checklist without changing the pillar weight (stays at 25)
